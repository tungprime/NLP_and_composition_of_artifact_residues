Determining the composition of artifact residues is a central problem in ancient residue metabolomics. Traditionally, this is done by comparing mass spectra features in common with an experimental pipe and a sample pipe (classical method). While this method is simple and straightforward, its prediction capabilities can be inaccurate. Here, we introduce a novel algorithm (new method) based on ideas from the field of natural language processing to solve this problem.


This github respository contains the data and the codes that we implemented in our article.
